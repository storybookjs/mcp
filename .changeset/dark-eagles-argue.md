Add support for Webpack (including Webpack-based frameworks like Next.js)

# Breaking Change

This requires version 10.1 of Storybook, currently only available as the canary verison `0.0.0-pr-32816-sha-28f59f53`. If you want to continue to use the addon with Storybook 9 or 10.0 (and Vite), stick to [version `0.0.9` of this package](https://github.com/storybookjs/mcp/tree/%40storybook/addon-mcp%400.0.9).
