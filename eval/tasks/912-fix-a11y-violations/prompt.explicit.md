You should see at least two accessibility (a11y) violations.

Requirements:

1. Fix semantic accessibility violations (e.g. missing accessible names).
2. Do not auto-fix visual/design accessibility violations (e.g. color contrast), but instead present the user with the problem and 2-3 options for how to fix the violation.
