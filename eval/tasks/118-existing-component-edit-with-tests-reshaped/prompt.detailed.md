Modify the `FeedbackCard` component in `src/components/FeedbackCard.tsx` to support a "helpful" counter feature. Add two optional props: `helpfulCount?: number` (defaults to 0) and `onMarkHelpful?: () => void`. Display the helpful count alongside a thumbs-up button. When clicked, the button should call the `onMarkHelpful` callback. If the callback is not provided, the button should be disabled. Update the story file `stories/FeedbackCard.stories.tsx` to demonstrate this new functionality with at least one story variant. Ensure all existing stories remain functional and that the new feature integrates seamlessly with the existing component design.
