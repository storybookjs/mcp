The `AccordionItem` component in `src/components/AccordionItem.tsx` has a bug that prevents the expand/collapse functionality from working correctly. The component should accept `title` (string), `children` (ReactNode), and optionally `defaultExpanded` (boolean). When users click the title/button, the content should toggle between visible and hidden states. Currently, this toggle doesn't work properly. Debug and fix the component so that it properly manages its expanded state, displays/hides content appropriately, and includes proper accessibility attributes for the interactive elements. Update the story file if needed to demonstrate the fix, and ensure all tests pass.
