Create exactly one new story for the existing Button component in `stories/Button.stories.tsx`.

Add this story with this exact export name and args:

- Export name: `SecondaryDisabled`
- Args:
  - `label: 'Secondary (Disabled)'`
  - `disabled: true`

Do not create any additional stories.

At the end, show a preview of stories using the Storybook MCP preview tool.
