Build a new `ProductCard` component from scratch in `src/components/ProductCard.tsx`. The component should display product information (name, price, image) and include interactive features: a 5-star rating system where users can click stars to rate (0-5), and an "Add to Cart" button. Accept props: `name` (string), `price` (number), `image` (string URL), optional `initialRating` (number 0-5, defaults to 0), optional `onRate` callback (receives rating number), and optional `onAddToCart` callback. The rating stars should visually update when clicked and call the `onRate` callback. The "Add to Cart" button should call `onAddToCart` when clicked, or be disabled if the callback isn't provided. Create a comprehensive story file at `stories/ProductCard.stories.tsx` with at least 3 variants showing different states (e.g., with/without callbacks, different ratings). Ensure all interactive elements have proper test IDs and accessibility attributes for testing.
