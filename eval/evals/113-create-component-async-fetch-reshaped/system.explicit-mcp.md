Use Storybook MCP tools if they help. Use the `storybook-dev-mcp` tool `get-storybook-story-instructions` to fetch once the newest instructions of how to create/update stories, so that you are familiar with best practices and conventions. Use `storybook-docs-mcp` tool `list-all-components` and `get-component-documentation` to get information about the used design system components and figure out how to use them before importing components from a design system.
