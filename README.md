# Storybook MCP - Contributor Guide

Welcome to the Storybook MCP Addon monorepo! This project enables AI agents to work more efficiently with Storybook by providing an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes UI component information and development workflows.

## üì¶ Packages

This monorepo contains two main packages:

- **[@storybook/mcp](./packages/mcp)** - Standalone MCP library for serving Storybook component knowledge (can be used independently)
- **[@storybook/addon-mcp](./packages/addon-mcp)** - Storybook addon that runs an MCP server within your Storybook dev server, and includes the functionality of **[@storybook/mcp](./packages/mcp)** from your local Storybook

Each package has its own README with user-facing documentation. This document is for **contributors** looking to develop, test, or contribute to these packages.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24+** - The project requires Node.js 24 or higher (see `.nvmrc`)
- **pnpm 10.19.0+** - Strict package manager requirement (enforced in `package.json`)

```bash
# Use the correct Node version
nvm use

# Install pnpm if you don't have it
npm install -g pnpm@10.19.0
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-mcp.git
cd addon-mcp

# Install all dependencies (for all packages in the monorepo)
pnpm install
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start development mode (watches for changes in all packages)
pnpm dev

# Run unit tests
pnpm storybook

# Run Storybook with the addon for testing
pnpm storybook
```

The `pnpm storybook` command starts:

- The internal test Storybook instance on `http://localhost:6006`
- The addon in watch mode, so changes are reflected automatically
- MCP server available at `http://localhost:6006/mcp`

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tasks

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build a specific package
pnpm --filter @storybook/addon-mcp build
pnpm --filter @storybook/mcp build
```

### Testing

Currently, only the `mcp` package has automated tests:

```bash
# Watch tests
pnpm test

# Run tests
pnpm test run

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test run --coverage
```

The `addon-mcp` package relies on manual testing via the internal Storybook instance.

### Debugging MCP Servers

Use the MCP Inspector to debug and test MCP server functionality:

```bash
# Launches the MCP inspector (requires Storybook to be running)
pnpm inspect
```

This uses the configuration in `.mcp.inspect.json` to connect to your local MCP servers.

### Formatting

```bash
# Format all files
pnpm format

# Check formatting without changing files
pnpm format --check
```

## üìù Code Conventions

### TypeScript & Imports

**Always include file extensions** in relative imports:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct
import { foo } from './bar.ts';

// ‚ùå Wrong
import { foo } from './bar';
```

- **JSON imports** use the import attributes syntax:

```typescript
import pkg from '../package.json' with { type: 'json' };
```

## üö¢ Release Process

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management:

```bash
# 1. Create a changeset describing your changes
pnpm changeset
```

When you create a PR, add a changeset if your changes should trigger a release:

- Patch: Bug fixes, documentation updates
- Minor: New features, backward-compatible changes
- Major: Breaking changes

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Make your changes** following the code conventions above
3. **Test your changes** using the internal Storybook instance
4. **Create a changeset** if your changes warrant a release
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description
